## How to use Roles

:::tip

Looking to create your own roles? Check out the [role developer](./developers/ansible-roles.md) page!

:::

Roles are Ansible roles that are applied to VMs in Ludus after they are deployed and configured. It's easy to add a role to a Ludus VM, simply add the role to Ludus and then define the `roles` key in the config.

Roles are unique to each user on a Ludus host, which allows users to have different versions of roles, custom roles, etc without overwriting or breaking each other's roles.

:::tip Ansible Galaxy

Any ansible role (35,000+) can be used with Ludus, as long as it is compatible with the OS of the VM and the roles pre-requisites are met. You can search for roles on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/).

:::

To add a role to Ludus, use the client as the user that will deploy the role (optionally specify the user/range that will use the role with `--user`)

```bash
# Add directly from Ansible Galaxy
#terminal-command-local
ludus ansible role add badsectorlabs.ludus_adcs

# Add from a local directory
#terminal-command-local
ludus ansible role add -d ./ludus_child_domain

# Add a role for another user/range (as an admin)
#terminal-command-local
ludus ansible role add badsectorlabs.luds_adcs --user USER2
```

After roles have been added to Ludus, you can modify the range config to use them:

```yaml title="range-config.yml"
ludus:
  - vm_name: "{{ range_id }}-docker-host"
    hostname: "{{ range_id }}-docker"
    template: debian-12-x64-server-template
    vlan: 10
    ip_last_octet: 11
    ram_gb: 8
    cpus: 4
    linux: true
    //highlight-next-line
    roles:                  # This key is an array of user-defined roles that will be installed on this VM. Roles must exist on the Ludus server and can be installed with `ludus ansible role add`
    //highlight-next-line
      - geerlingguy.docker  # Arbitrary role name, as it appears in `ludus ansible roles list`
    role_vars:              # This key contains `key: value` pairs of variables that are passed to ALL user-defined roles.
      docker_edition: ce    # Arbitrary variables for user-defined roles. Do *not* use hyphens to prefix these variables, the role_vars key *must* be a dictionary!
      docker_users:         # You can use lists or dicts here
        - localuser
```

You can define any variables that will be passed to the role with `role_vars` as seen above. Note that all variable in `role_vars` will be passed to all roles.
