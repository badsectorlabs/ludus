## No stylesheet loaded 

This is a [known bug](https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC/issues/207).
Opening the web inspector and clicking the network tab, reloading the page, and double clicking the style.dist.css file (which opens it in a new window), then reloading the KasmVNC page seems to fix it.
