# üóíÔ∏è Range Configuration

The Ludus range configuration file is a yaml document that describes the virtual machines and optionally the network rules, router settings, and defaults a user would like to deploy.

An example file is described below:

import Schema from "@site/static/schemas/range-config.json";
import JSONSchemaViewer from "@theme/JSONSchemaViewer";


:::tip

You can add

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://docs.ludus.cloud/schemas/range-config.json
```
to the top of your range config to get schema validation in your editor, if your editor supports it.
