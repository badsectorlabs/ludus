# Basic Active Directory Network

Ludus users are created with a basic Active Directory network as their configuration.

The configuration, if deployed without modification, looks like this (for UserID: `JD` with RangeID: `2`):

![Network Diagram](/img/envs/basic-active-directory-network.png)

This network contains a Domain Controller (`JD-DC01-2019`), and Windows 11 workstation (`JD-WIN11-22H2-1` with Office 2019 64bit, Chrome, Firefox, Burpsuite, VSCode, 7zip, process hacker, ilspy and other useful utilities), and a Kali VM (`JD-Kali`) in a separate network.
The Windows hosts can only reach the Kali VM on tcp/80, tcp/443, and tcp/8080.
The Kali VM can reach the Windows VM on any protocol and any port.

When testing mode is enabled, both Windows hosts will be snapshotted and blocked from reaching the internet, while the Kali VM will not be snapshotted or blocked from reaching the internet.

The configuration for this range is below:
