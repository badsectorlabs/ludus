# ðŸ†™ Updating Ludus

:::tip[Don't trust the binaries?]

    Ludus binaries are built in CI, but you can always [build them from source](./developers/building-from-source.md) yourself.

:::

## Updating a Ludus server 

Simply run the install script again. It will detect an existing installation and update the server.

```shell
# terminal-command-local
ssh user@ludus

# All-in-one command
curl -s https://ludus.cloud/install | bash

# If you want to check out the install script
curl https://ludus.cloud/install > install.sh
cat install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

1. Run the Ludus server binary as root with the `--update` flag.

```
