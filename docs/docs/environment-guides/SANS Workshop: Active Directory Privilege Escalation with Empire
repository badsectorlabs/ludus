# SANS Workshop: Active Directory Privilege Escalation with Empire!

:::success Props!

Huge shout out to [@ladhaAleem](https://twitter.com/LadhaAleem) for creating this project and converting the SANS Workshop: Active Directory Privilege Escalation with Empire! workshop created by [Jean-FranÃ§ois Maes]https://www.sans.org/profiles/jeanfrancois-maes/) to an ansible playbook and making it work with Ludus as well!
:::

## Description from SANS Workshop: Active Directory Privilege Escalation with Empire!

Welcome to this workshop where we are going to dive into a core active directory component - Kerberos!

This lab is a self-guided Active Directory security exercise designed to help participants understand Kerberos-based privilege escalation attacks. Originally part of a SANS workshop, this lab is now freely available for local deployment on VMware, VirtualBox, and Ludus.

Participants will build their own AD lab, configure attack tools, and execute real-world attack techniques to escalate privileges in an Active Directory environment.

This workshop is ideally suited for blue teamers that want to peek behind the curtain and understand how adversaries attack AD and pentesters that may not be as familiar with AD environments yet.

Attacks Covered
ðŸ”¹ Kerberoasting â€“ Extracting service tickets to crack passwords
ðŸ”¹ DCSyncing â€“ Extracting credentials by simulating a domain controller
ðŸ”¹ SID History Abuse â€“ Hopping across parent/child domain trusts
ðŸ”¹ Unconstrained Delegation Abuse â€“ Capturing privileged credentials

### Note

Note: The following labs are related only to the usage of Empire & Starkiller and no other tools

Have fun !

### Access the workbook here:

## Deployment

### 1. Add the Windows 2019 template to Ludus

```bash
#terminal-command-local
git clone https://gitlab.com/badsectorlabs/ludus
#terminal-command-local
cd ludus/templates
#terminal-command-local
ludus templates add -d win2019-server-x64
[INFO]  Successfully added template
#terminal-command-local
ludus templates build
[INFO]  Template building started - this will take a while. Building 1 template(s) at a time.
# Wait until the templates finish building, you can monitor them with `ludus templates logs -f` or `ludus templates status`
#terminal-command-local
ludus templates list
+----------------------------------------+-------+
|                TEMPLATE                | BUILT |
+----------------------------------------+-------+
| debian-11-x64-server-template          | TRUE  |
| debian-12-x64-server-template          | TRUE  |
| kali-x64-desktop-template              | TRUE  |
| win11-22h2-x64-enterprise-template     | TRUE  |
| win2022-server-x64-template            | TRUE  |
| win2019-server-x64-template            | TRUE  |
+----------------------------------------+-------+
```

### 2. Deploy VMs

Set and deploy the configuration for the lab.

```bash
#terminal-command-local
git clone https://github.com/aleemladha/SANS-Workshop-Lab
#terminal-command-local
ludus range config set -f SANS-Workshop-Lab/ad/SANS/providers/ludus/config.yml
#terminal-command-local
ludus range deploy
# Wait for the range to successfully deploy
# You can watch the logs with `ludus range logs -f`
# Or check the status with `ludus range status`
```


### 3. Install requirements

Install ansible and its requirements for the NetExec lab on your local machine.

```shell-session
# You can use a virtualenv here if you would like
#terminal-command-local
python3 -m pip install ansible-core
#terminal-command-local
python3 -m pip install pywinrm
#terminal-command-local
git clone https://github.com/aleemladha/SANS-Workshop-Lab
#terminal-command-local
cd SANS-Workshop-Lab/ansible
#terminal-command-local
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

### 4. Setup  the inventory files

The inventory file is already present in the providers folder and replace RANGENUMBER with your range number with sed (commands provided below)


<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
```bash
#terminal-command-local
cd SANS-Workshop-Lab/ansible
# go the the ansible directory as above
#terminal-command-local
export RANGENUMBER=$(ludus range list --json | jq '.rangeNumber')
# `sudo apt install jq` if you don't have jq
#terminal-command-local
sed -i "s/RANGENUMBER/$RANGENUMBER/g" ../ad/SANS/providers/ludus/inventory.yml
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
```bash
#terminal-command-local
cd SANS-Workshop-Lab/ansible
# paste in the inventory file above
#terminal-command-local
export RANGENUMBER=$(ludus range list --json | jq '.rangeNumber')
# `brew install jq` if you don't have jq
#terminal-command-local
sed -i '' "s/RANGENUMBER/$RANGENUMBER/g" ../ad/SANS/providers/ludus/inventory.yml
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### 5. Deploy the SANS Workshop

:::note

If not running on the Ludus host, you must be connected to your Ludus wireguard VPN for these commands to work

:::

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
```bash
#terminal-command-local
cd SANS-Workshop-Lab/ansible
# in the ansible folder perform the following
#terminal-command-local
export ANSIBLE_COMMAND="ansible-playbook -i ../ad/SANS/data/inventory -i ../ad/SANS/providers/ludus/inventory.yml"
#terminal-command-local
export LAB="SANS"
#terminal-command-local
chmod +x ../scripts/provisionning.sh
#terminal-command-local
../scripts/provisionning.sh
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
```bash
#terminal-command-local
cd SANS-Workshop-Lab/ansible
# In the ansible folder perform the following
#terminal-command-local
export ANSIBLE_COMMAND="ansible-playbook -i ../ad/SANS/data/inventory -i ../ad/SANS/providers/ludus/inventory.yml"
#terminal-command-local
export LAB="SANS"
#terminal-command-local
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
#terminal-command-local
../scripts/provisionning.sh
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you wait. `[WARNING]` lines are ok, and some steps may take a long time, don't panic!

This will take a few hours. You'll know it is done when you see:

```
The Empire's dominion is complete! But Rebel operatives remain hidden. Your mission: eliminate them.
```
:::note

You must be connected to your Ludus wireguard VPN for these commands to work


### 6. Snapshot VMs

Take snapshots via the proxmox web UI or SSH into ludus and as root run the following

```bash
export RANGEID=JD # <= change to your ID
vms=("$RANGEID-dc01" "$RANGEID-dc02" "$RANGEID-srv02" "$RANGEID-kali")
COMMENT="Clean SANS Lab setup after ansible run"
# Loop over the array
for vm in "${vms[@]}"
do
  echo "[+] Create snapshot for $vm"
  id=$(qm list | grep $vm  | awk '{print $1}')
  echo "[+] VM id is : $id"
  qm snapshot "$id" 'snapshot-'$(date '+%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M') --vmstate 1 --description "$COMMENT"
done
```

### 7. Hack!

Access your Kali machine at `https://10.RANGENUMBER.50.99:8444` using the creds `kali:password`.

Setup Empire & Starkiller at `https://logout.gitbook.io/ad-privesc-with-empire/installing-the-environment/empire`

Once done, follow lab 2 in the workbook above

:::note

Replace this part with your RANGENUMBER 'xfreerdp /v:10.RANGENUMBER.20.10 /u:jross /p:'0nz2xQ44GumoWpl' +clipboard'

If you want a challange and want to the lab with defender , go to ad/SANS/data/inventory file, change the last part to look like this

```
; allow defender
; usage : security.yml
[defender_on]
dc01
dc02
dc03
srv02

; disable defender
; usage : security.yml
[defender_off]


```
