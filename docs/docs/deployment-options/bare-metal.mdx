# Bare Metal (recommended)

Ludus works best on a "bare metal" machine. This can be a rented cloud "bare metal" server or a local machine dedicated to Ludus.

Relatively inexpensive small form factor (SFF) computers excel as Ludus hosts (i.e. [Intel NUCs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html), [Minisforums](https://store.minisforum.com/), [Beelink](https://www.bee-link.com/), [GMKTec](https://www.gmktec.com/), etc.)

Cloud providers also offer dedicated or "bare metal" servers (i.e. [Contabo](https://contabo.com/en/dedicated-servers/), [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver?country=us&ram_from=32), [Equinix](https://deploy.equinix.com/product/bare-metal/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/products/bare-metal/), etc.)

When looking for a Ludus host, try to get as much RAM as possible, followed by as many fast cores as possible, and finally as much fast NVMe as you can.

## Our current recommendation

We have been using the GMKTec NucBox K8 (AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS 8c/16t base 3.8GhZ bost 5.1Ghz), 96 GB of 5600MHz RAM, and 2x 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe in RAID0.

While the GMKTec K9 has more cores (14c/18t) it has a lower passmark score (21572) compared to the K8 (29242) due to 10 cores being efficiency cores.

2x 2TB is overkill, and 2x 1TB in RAID0 would likely be enough for most use cases.
