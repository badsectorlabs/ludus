# Proxmox

:::warning

Using an existing Proxmox installation may cause issues with existing customizations as it is impossible for Ludus to account for every Proxmox setup. If starting from scratch the [bare metal Debian 12/13 install](./bare-metal) is recommended.

:::

Existing Proxmox 8/9 servers can install Ludus without a reboot.

Ludus will make the following changes - **do NOT do any actions below yourself before running the install script**:

- Extract files to `/opt/ludus`
- Install the following packages to the Proxmox host: ansible, packer, dnsmasq, sshpass, curl, jq, iptables-persistent, gpg-agent, dbus, dbus-user-session, and vim
- Install the following python packages to the host: proxmoxer, requests, netaddr, pywinrm, dnspython, and jmespath
- Create the proxmox groups `ludus_users` and `ludus_admins`
- Create the proxmox pools `SHARED` and `ADMIN`
- Create a wireguard server wg0 with IP range `198.51.100.0/24`
- Create an interface `vmbr1000` with IP range 192.0.2.0/24 that NATs traffic
- Create user ranges with IPs in the 10.0.0.0/16 network starting at 10.2.0.0/8 and incrementing the second octet for each user
- Create user interfaces starting at `vmbr1002` incrementing for each user
- Create the pam user `ludus` and pam users for all Ludus users added
- Create the `ludus-admin` and `ludus` systemd services that listen on 127.0.0.1:8081 and 0.0.0.0:8080

## Install

1. Run the install script. Be careful to choose your datastores correctly!

```shell
# All-in-one command
curl -s https://ludus.cloud/install | bash

# If you want to check out the install script
curl https://ludus.cloud/install > install.sh
cat install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

2. Follow the Quick start guide as normal starting at [Create a User](../quick-start/create-a-user).


If you made a mistake, you can update the values in `/opt/ludus/config.yml` to reflect the install.
After updating the config, restart the ludus processes with `systemctl restart ludus-admin` and `systemctl restart ludus`.

If you changed the datastores you are using with Ludus, you will need to give permissions to the `ludus_users` and `ludus_admins` group. As root on your Promox host, run the following:

```shell
pveum acl modify /storage/<your new storage> -group ludus_users -role DatastoreUser
pveum acl modify /storage/<your new storage> -group ludus_admins -role PVEDatastoreAdmin
```

If you encounter networking issues like VMs not getting IP addresses or having internet access, see [this guide](../troubleshooting/network.md).
