# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of Ludus** and and worked with the **default configuration**.

Ludus has **much more to offer**!

Have **5 more minutes**? Take a look at **[configuration](../configuration)** and the **[Ludus CLI](../cli)**.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://gitlab.com/badsectorlabs/ludus/-/issues)

## What's next?

- Modify your range [configuration](../configuration)
- Learn about Ludus' [networking](../networking)
- Read the [API documentation](pathname:///api/index.html)
- Add a [custom chocolatey package](../configuration) to Windows machines
- [Sysprep](../configuration) Windows machines
- Set up [CI/CD](../cicd)
- Get to know the power of [ansible roles](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/Developers/ansible-roles/). Check out our [public roles](https://github.com/badsectorlabs). Deploy these roles to your virtual machines without all the mess.
